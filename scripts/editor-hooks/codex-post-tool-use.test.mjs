// Tests for codex-post-tool-use.mjs.
//
// `parseTouchedFiles` is the pure half of the Codex hook — it reads the file
// names out of an apply_patch command text — so it is the half worth pinning.
// The rest of the adapter spawns the shared editor-hook scripts with that
// list; a test that stubbed those spawns would only pin the stub, and the
// real thing is exercised by a Codex session. Each case below goes red in the
// SILENT direction: an unparsed file name means the gates never run on that
// file, which is exactly the quiet gap the hook exists to close.
