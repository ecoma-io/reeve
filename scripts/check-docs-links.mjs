// Fails on any local reference to a document that does not exist, in either of
// the two shapes a reference takes in this repository:
//
//   1. Markdown links `[text](target)` — the target's file must exist, resolved
//      relative to the file that carries the link, and a `#anchor` fragment
//      naming a heading in that SAME file must match a heading actually there.
//      A link carried by a page INSIDE docs/ must land INSIDE docs/: the
//      documentation is a self-contained tree, so a docs page that links to
//      `../CONTRIBUTING.md` or `../../packages/…` is a failure — its subject
//      belongs in docs/, and a reader of docs/ is a docs reader. Markdown
//      files OUTSIDE docs/ keep the right to link INTO docs/ (the direction a
//      reader is steered toward); only the reverse is refused.
//   2. Prose citations `docs/...` or `../docs/...` in `.mjs` comments and
//      strings and in `.md` prose — resolved from the workspace root when they
//      begin with `docs/`, from the carrying file when they begin with `../` or
//      `./`.
//
// WHY this script exists. The docs live in docs/, and a reader of docs/ is a
// docs reader: a page there must not link out to a root markdown file or a
// package README, and no reference — markdown link or prose citation — may
// point at a path that does not exist. No existing gate saw either failure:
// Prettier formats markdown but does not resolve a link, markdownlint's
// closest rule (MD051) checks only `#anchor` fragments within one file, and
// ESLint never reads prose. A broken reference is invisible until someone
// clicks it.
//
// The facts are read from the filesystem by `readFacts`; the judgment is the
// pure function `evaluate`, which takes those facts as arguments and returns
// verdicts, so the tests need no filesystem and no mocking library.
//
// Resolution rules, stated once:
//   - a markdown link target resolves relative to the file that carries it;
//   - a citation beginning with `docs/` resolves from the workspace root
//     (this repository's convention for prose references);
//   - a citation beginning with `../` or `./` resolves from its carrying file;
//   - a page inside docs/ may only link to another page inside docs/;
//   - everything else is not a reference to this repository's docs and is
//     ignored.
//
// External targets (`http:`, `https:`, `mailto:`) and fragment-only targets
// on a DIFFERENT file are not resolved: the first lives outside the tree this
// gate can see, and the second is a promise about another file's headings that
// GitHub's own anchor handling does not even guarantee — a `#fragment` on the
// same file is checked because markdownlint's MD051 does it and it is cheap;
// a `file.md#fragment` one is checked only for the file half.
